== Project: FoodZoom

---

I am a year 2 Computer Science Student studying in National University of Singapore. I am
interested in using technology to solve everyday problems and am always on the lookout for
any challenging project to work with. This is a portfolio page which serves to document my
work on FoodZoom.

== Overview

FoodZoom is a food delivery management desktop application for food businesses to streamline their
delivery process. FoodZoom is responsive and quick as users interact with the application by typing the
commands (using Command Line Interface). FoodZoom allows managers to plan order delivery routes and
dispatch them to deliverymen available. FoodZoom is built by a team of five.

== Summary of Contribution

|Given below are contributions that I made to this application.

* *Major enhancements*:

- Added Functionality to do location-based matching of orders on a map:.

** What it does: All pending orders are displayed on the map. This map is able to update itself when
the order list is changed.

** Justification: This is one of the code features of the application. Managers using the application can now
track where their pending orders are in one glance. It allows for efficient dispatch of the respective orders to
the deliverymen involved. It works without internet and has no reliance on any external service.

** Highlights: The order location is calculated from the postal code given in the address. The size of the
               placeholder indicates how many orders they are in a particular location.

- Designed the dashboard that gives key insights based on the patterns of orders that come in:

** What it does: Dashboard on the application that dynamically changes when the order list is filtered or
                 viewed. It shows pending orders and order history for the week.

** Justification: The feature allows for managers to gather insights on their business. They can see what are
                  their most trending food items and peruse their order history for the week.

** Highlights: The data is collected based on the available orders in the application. The data dynamically updates
itself when the list is filtered or adjusted.


* *Minor enhancements*:

** Enhanced and came up with the User Interface for the application
** Added essential fields such as address and date to order model.
** Came up with `/home` command to return to the dashboard panel
** Various Bug Fixes
