By: `Team T16-3`      Since: `Oct 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `OrderBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `OrderBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedOrderBook`.
It extends `OrderBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `orderBookStateList` and
`currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedOrderBook#commit()` -- Saves the current order book state in its history.
* `VersionedOrderBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous order book state from its history.
* `VersionedOrderBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone order book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitOrderBook()`, `Model#undoOrderBook()` and
`Model#redoOrderBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedOrderBook` will be initialized with the
initial order book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single order book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th order in the order book. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitOrderBook()`, causing the modified state of the order book after the `delete 5` command executes to be
saved in the `orderBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted order book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `/order add ...` to add a new order. The `add` command also calls
`Model#commitOrderBook()`, causing another modified order book state to be saved into the `orderBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitOrderBook()`, so the order book state will not be saved
into the `orderBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the order was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoOrderBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once
 to the left, pointing it to the previous order book state, and restores the order book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial order book state, then there are no previous
order book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoOrderBook()` to check if this is the case. If so,
it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoOrderBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
 to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `orderBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest order book state,
then there are no undone order book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoOrderBook()` to check if
this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `/order list`. Commands that do not modify the order book, such
 as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitOrderBook()`, `Model#undoOrderBook()` or `Model#redoOrderBook()`.
 Thus, the `orderBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `/order clear`, which calls `Model#commitOrderBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `orderBookStateList`, all order book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `/order add ...` command. This is
the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire order book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of order book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both
`HistoryManager` and `VersionedOrderBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Login Command
==== Current Implementation

The `/login` command allows the `Manager` to login into the FoodZoom application and use authenticated commands like
`/order add`, `/order edit`, `/order list`, ... .Basically all the `/order` commands and `/deliveryman` commands. The
only commands that can be used without logging in are `/signup`, `/login`, `/help` and `/history`. The format of this
 command is `/login u/[USERNAME] pw/[PASSWORD]`.

In our current implementation, the `/login` command inherits from `Command` class. 2 components, `Logic` and `Model`
are involved in the execution of this command. The `Logic` class is responsible for parsing the user input and the
`Model` class deals with storing the `UserSession` and checking if the user is logged in or not.

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates how these 2 components interact when the `/login` command is executed:

image::LoginCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.2.1.1 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` component interactions for `/login`.

image::LoginCommandSequenceDiagram2.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.2.1.2 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` and `Model` component interactions for `/login`.

As shown above, execution of the `/login` command comprises of the following steps:

1. `LogicManager` invokes the `parseCommand` method of `OrderBookParser`, taking in user inputs as arguments.
2. During the `parseCommand` method call, an instance of `LoginCommandParser` will be created with the keyword
`/login` is matched. `LoginCommandParser` then extracts the remaining user inputs and a `LoginCommand` instance will
be returned provided that the user's input is correct.
3. `LoginCommand` then invokes `isRegisteredUser` method which belongs to `ModelManager` class. The `ModelManager`
will the invoke `IsRegisteredUser` method in `UsersList` to check if the user is in the list of users.
4. After checking if the user is in the list, if it returns `true` then `storeUserInSession` method will be invoked
to store the `User` object inside `UserSession`. The `execute` method will then return a `CommandResult` with success
 login message.
5. If the user is not in the list, `execute` method will just return a `CommandResult` with failure to login message.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `/login` executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check if user is in users list.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Not necessary to implement users list because there will only be 1 user.

* **Alternative 2:** Automatic login even after application is opened more than once.
** Pros: User do not need to login multiple times after application is re-opened.
** Cons: Difficult to implement because it requires caching user details locally.

===== Aspect: Data Structure to support `/login` command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a unique user list to store all the user and create a `users.xml` to
store locally.
** Pros: Easy to implement and you can make sure that there is only unique users.
** Cons: Not necessary because there would only be 1 user using the application.

* **Alternative 2:** Store user session inside `User` class
** Pros: Easy to handle login session.
** Cons: Would break the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) because `User` class should only be about the user and
 nothing to do with login at all.

===== Aspect: Checking if user is logged in

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check if user is logged in after command is parsed
** Pros: It is easy to implement and it doesn't violate the SRP because it wouldn't make sense to check if the user
is logged in inside a method that is supposed to be parsing the user input.
** Cons: User is able to type authenticated commands like `/order add` and receive a parse exception which is the
incorrect behavior.

* **Alternative 2:** Check if user is logged in before command is parsed
** Pros: It is easy to implement.
** Cons: It breaks the SRP because `parseCommand` method should only be used to parse commands and not check for user
 logged in status.

=== Add Order Feature

==== Current Implementation
The `add` order command allows the `Manager` to create a new order and add it to the list of orders.
Adding a new order requires the customer's `name`, customer's `phone` number, customer's `address`, `food` and the `datetime`. +
The format of the `add` command is `/order add f/FOOD n/NAME p/PHONE a/ADDRESS dt/DATETIME`.

The following sequence shows the sequence when the `add` command is execute by the `Manager`:

image::OrderAddSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]
Figure 3.3.1.1 Sequence Diagram for order `find` command

From the diagram above:

.  `LogicManager`'s execute is called when the `Manager` keys in `/order add` and it calls upon `parseCommand` of `OrderBookParser` to parse the command
.  `OrderBookParser` will initialize `OrderCommandParser` and invoke the method `parse` to further parse `order` command
.  `AddCommandParser` will be invoked and passed the parameters of the add command.
.  If all the arguments of the `add` commands are valid, `AddCommand` will be returned to the `LogicManager`
.  `LogicManger` will then calls the method `execute` method of `AddCommand`
.  `AddCommand` will call `addOrder` passing `Order` as an argument to `Model` and after calls `commitOrderBook` method from `Model`
.  A `CommandResult` will be returned at the end,

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Data Structure of list of order
* **Alternative 1 (Current Approach):** Using a `UniqueOrderList`
** Pros: The comparison is not as rigid. You can create orders with similar names/address as long as it passes a less stringent criteria.
** Cons: You need additional overhead. You need to create an extra class and function to check.

* **Alternative 2:** Using a `Set`
** Pros: Do not need an extra function. You can use use `equals` for comparison
** Cons: It is a strict check and as a result you will not be allowed to create orders with same address/same name etc.

===== Aspect: Data Structure of `Order`
* **Alternative 1 (Current Approach):** All parameters in `Order` are abstracted out to have a class of its own.
** Pros: It adheres to the Single Responsibility Principles (SRP) and the Separation of Concerns (SoC) as each parameter checks whether it is valid
** Cons: Many different classes are created which increases the complexity of the code

* **Alternative 2:** Store all parameters of `Order` as `String`
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Violates SRP as one single class will need to check if the arguments are valid.

=== Find Order Feature

==== Current Implementation
The order `find` command allows searching of orders in FoodZoom. It allows searching for orders with any order fields.

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence flow from the `LogicManager` to the `ModelManager` when a user enter a `find` command:

image::OrderFindSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]
Figure 3.4.1.1 Sequence Diagram for order `find` command

From the sequence diagram:

.  When `LogicManager` receive the `execute` command, it calls the `parseCommand` method in `OrderBookParser`.
.  `OrderBookParser` will receive `/order` as the command and instantiate `OrderCommandParser` to further parse the command.
.  `OrderCommandParser` receive `find` as the command and calls `FindCommandParser` to handle the fields for the find command.
.  If at least one field is provided, `FindCommandParser` will call `parsePredicate` of `OrderPredicateUtil` to handle the given fields.
.  `OrderPredicateUtil` will call its own `chainPredicate` to create the predicate for the relevant fields.
.  If all fields give are valid, `FindCommand` will be created and return back to `LogicManager`.
.  `LogicManager` will proceed to call execute of `FindCommand`.
.  `FindCommand` will update the list in the `Model` and create a new `CommandResult` to be returned.

The differentiation is handled by `OrderPredicateUtil` which checks for the fields provided. It throws `ParseException` if a invalid order field is specified or when any field is given without any value.

`OrderPredicateUtil` will chain up the different fields and return a `Predicate<Order>` to narrow the scope
of the search.

`Datetime` search can be performed in two ways. Below is a sequence diagram to show flow of how `datetime` search:

image::OrderDatePredicate.png[width="650"]
Figure 3.4.1.2 Sequence Diagram for `datetime` search

* If one `datetime` field is given, `OrderDatePredicate` creates a `OrderDateSinglePredicate` object and run its' `test` method.

* If more than one `datetime` field is given, `OrderDatePredicate` creates a `OrderDateRangePredicate` object and run its' `test` method.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Implementation of `FindCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** All different order field having its own test method.
** Pros: It adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Separation of Concern (SoC). Each predicate handles its own search values.
** Cons: More classes will be needed, which results in higher complexity of the code base.
* **Alternative 2:** One predicate class to handle all the predicates.
** Pros: Reduces the number of classes, which makes it for new developers to understand.
** Cons: It decreases the cohesion as one class will need to handle different predicates.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `FindCommandParser`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Further parsing of the predicates are passed to `OrderPredicateUtil` to handle
** Pros: It adheres to SRP as the handling of the predicates are passed on to `OrderPredicateUtil` class.
** Cons: Increase in the complexity of the code as more classes are needed, with more lines of code being written
* **Alternative 2:** `FindCommandParser` to handles the predicates.
** Pros: It makes it easy for new developers to understand the code as `FindCommandParser` handles all the parsing of the predicates
** Cons: It violates SRP. `FindCommandParser` has to break down the fields as well as check which fields are present.

=== Add deliveryman feature

==== Current Implementation

The `add` deliveryman command allows the Manager to add deliveryman into FoodZoom. It ensures that the newly-added deliveryman
is not a duplicate of an existing deliveryman.

The following diagram shows the sequence flow from the `LogicManager` to the `ModelManager` when a user enters a `/deliveryman add`
command:

image::DeliverymanAddCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]
Figure 3.5.1.1 Sequence Diagram for deliveryman `add` command

From Figure 3.5.1.1:

1. When `LogicManager` receives the `execute` command from the App, it calls the `parseCommand` method in `OrderBookParser`.

2. `OrderBookParser` will receive `/deliveryman` as the command and instantiate `DeliverymanCommandParser` to parse the rest of the command.

3. If the arguments specified in the `add` command are valid, a `DeliverymanAddCommand` would be created and returned back
to the `LogicManager`.

4. `LogicManager` would proceed to call `execute` of the `DeliverymanAddCommand`.

5. A new deliveryman would be added and a successful `CommandResult` would be returned and displayed.

FoodZoom's deliveryman is only stored with names currently, and can be search and listed
only with names.

These names are checked against validations with the `Name` model, and this is a compulsory
field for a deliveryman to be added. If the provided command either does not have a name, or is an invalid `Name`,
a `ParseException` would be thrown.

==== Design Considerations

===== Implementation of `DeliverymanAddCommandParser`
* ** Alternative 1 (current choice):** `DeliverymanCommand` is parsed first, then as a `DeliverymanAddCommand`.
** Pros: Better modularization for all commands relating to `Deliveryman`
** Cons: More complicated file & package organization

* ** Alternative 2: ** `DeliverymanAddCommand` is parsed straight from `OrderBookParser`
** Pros: Easier to manage file structure
** Cons: Poor modularization of related `Command` classes.

===== Implementation of `DeliverymanAddCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deliverymen are stored in separate file
** Pros: Allows for greater flexibility in how deliverymen interact with other resources like order/routes - better separation of concerns.
** Cons: Harder to implement & maintain

* **Alternative 2:** Deliverymen are stored in the same file as `Order`
** Pros: Easier to implement & maintain
** Cons: Deliveryman can only be accessed & treated as parts of an `Order`

=== Create Route Feature [deprecated since v1.2.1]
This feature is deprecated as there was a design change regarding the relationship between delivery man and order.
Previously, route was the middleman between delivery men and orders. Now, delivery men and orders are directly related.
Route is removed as its existence will complicate implementations of other features without adding much benefit.

==== Current Implementation
The `create` route command allows creation of routes in FoodZoom.
It allows creating routes based on the order ids.

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence flow from the `LogicManager` to the `ModelManager` when a user enter a `/route create` command:

image::CreateRouteCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[width=800]
Figure 3.6.1.1 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` component interactions for route `create` command.

image::CreateRouteCommandSequenceDiagram2.png[width=800]
Figure 3.6.1.2 Sequence diagram to illustrate `Logic` and `Model` component interactions for route `create` command.

From the sequence diagram:

.  When `LogicManager` receive the `execute` command, it calls the `parseCommand` method in `OrderBookParser`.
.  `OrderBookParser` will receive `/route` as the command and instantiate `RouteCommandParser` to further parse the command.
.  If the arguments specified in the `create` command are valid, a `CreateRouteCommand` will be created and return back to the `LogicManger`
.  `LogicManger` will proceed to call the `execute` command of `CreateRouteCommand`
.  `CreateRouteCommand` will proceed to call the `getFilteredOrderList` method of `Model`
.  Iterate through the `orderIds`, if valid, add the `Index` and the corresponding `Order` to the set of `Index` and `Order` respectively.
.  Create a `Route` from the set of `Order`
.  A new route would be added and create a new `CommandResult` to be returned.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Implementation of `CreateRouteCommandParser`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `RouteCommandParser` is parsed first, then pass to `CreateRouteCommandParser`
** Pros: Better modularization for `Route` commands, better cohesion, adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.
** Cons: More complicated file & package structure.
* **Alternative 2:** `CreateRouteCommand` is parsed straight from `OrderBookParser`.
** Pros: Easier to manage the file structure.
** Cons: Poor modularization of the `Command` classes.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/OrderBookParser.java[`OrderBookParser`] is responsible for
analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/OrderBookParser
.java[`OrderBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute
 the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model`

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/OrderBook.java[`OrderBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/OrderBook
.java[`OrderBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/OrderBook.java[`OrderBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/OrderBook.java[`OrderBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `OrderBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**

image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/OrderBookSystemTest.java[`OrderBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and OrderBookkSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleOrderBookChangedEvent
(OrderBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the orderbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/OrderBookSystemTest.java[`OrderBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupOrderBook(ReadOnlyOrderBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/OrderBookStorage.java[`OrderBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlOrderBookStorage.java[`XmlOrderBookStorage`] class.
* Solution

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `orderbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects.
The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/OrderBookParser.java[`OrderBookParser`] to accept a
`RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/OrderBookParserTest.java[`OrderBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/OrderBookParser.java[`OrderBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/OrderBookParserTest.java[`OrderBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks
for the sample data (delete your `orderBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonOrderBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsOrderBook.xml`, `validOrderBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
